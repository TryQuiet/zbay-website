      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph w-clearfix"><span class="zb-drop-cap">W</span>e made Zbay because we want a patch of online life that&#x27;s controlled by the people of the Internet. Not by one rich man in California, like Facebook is. Or by a reprehensible dictatorship, like WeChat and TikTok are. Or by a corporation legally bound to squeeze as much ad revenue from us as possible, like Google is.</p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Technically and institutionally speaking, this is hard to do. But it&#x27;s not impossible. To start somewhere, Zbay builds on two technical/institutional building blocks: free software and blockchain. </p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">In the year 1980, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while fixing a broken printer of all things, a software developer named Richard M. Stallman had a powerful revelation. He realized that software makers had legal—and technical—power to control software users, and that they could use this power in nefarious ways, to extort, spy, censor, or worse.</p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Stallman defined what he called the &quot;four freedoms” to rally software makers around a brighter future where software users were in control, not under control. The four freedoms were:</p>
      <ul class="zb-essay-list">
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">The freedom to run a program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">The freedom to understand how a program works, and change it how you wish.</li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">The freedom to redistribute copies of a program, to help others.<br></li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">The freedom to redistribute your changes, so the wider community can benefit from your work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">In 1989, Stallman wrote the GNU GPL, a politically ingenious legal contract that encoded the four freedoms into law. A software license, the GNU GPL gave software makers a legal, contractual way to give their users all four freedoms. This meant that anyone in the world could build on their work, but only if they granted others the same freedoms, and released it under a similar license.<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Because of these clever rules, the body of code available under the GNU GPL grew like wildfire. Stallman called software that respected your freedoms &quot;Free Software&quot;, and licenses like the GNU GPL &quot;copyleft”—a play on &quot;copyright.&quot;  </p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Stallman’s smart activism birthed a flourishing social movement which could actually be the most successful social movement in history. Right now nearly every organization in the world uses free software in some way. Android, an operating system built on free software, powers 2.5 billion phones and tablets worldwide. Thanks to free software, computing isn&#x27;t just for rich people anymore, and software companies have an important check on their power to control us. </p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Free software has specific historical consequences as well. For example, free software let Edward Snowden and journalist Laura Poitras communicate privately, so they could blow the whistle on the world&#x27;s most powerful spy agencies, the NSA and GCHQ.<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Most of all, free software contains a powerful institutional guarantee: if software makers start going against the interests of their users, users can band together, take the code, and build in a new direction. </p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Despite this, many modern software companies go against the interests of their users. Advertising is a simple example. Given the choice, most users would prefer to not be subjected to advertising. But popular platforms like Youtube, Facebook and Spotify still force users to watch ads. If free software is so powerful, how are so many prominent companies able to go against users’ interests?<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">The free software movement had some important limitations. Because of the freedoms it granted, companies could use GPL-licensed code however they chose to. As long as they didn&#x27;t “distribute” it, they didn&#x27;t have to give their users the four freedoms. Selling an app was &quot;distributing&quot; software, but using code to run a website (like Facebook.com or Google.com) was not. Copyleft licenses didn&#x27;t have the same power over a website, precisely because free software gives so much freedom to its users.<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Even worse, once Facebook and Google opted to run software on their machines, any control that free software code could give to users was an escape hatch at best, and not a great one. Facebook is mostly running on Facebook&#x27;s computers, not yours. If they were doing something evil with your data, how would you know? It&#x27;s their computer. If you wanted to change something important, how would you? It&#x27;s their computer.</p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Plus, if you wanted to change something in Facebook&#x27;s code, why should others let you? You could be an awful person. You could make the code do something awful. In practice, control over Facebook&#x27;s code is too much power, so Facebook users have to trust Facebook. This reality suits Facebook just fine, because it puts Facebook in control.<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Stallman&#x27;s &quot;four freedoms&quot; only made sense when our apps ran on *our* computers. Once we stopped downloading apps and running them on our computers, and started mostly using websites like Facebook or Youtube, or apps dependent on company servers like Spotify, free software no longer provided a meaningful check on those companies’ power to control users. </p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Unlike with desktop apps like web browsers or newspapers, creating a free software competitor to something like Facebook or Youtube is a much trickier proposition. These applications have to connect—and balance the interests of—many different users. If software runs on each user’s computer, how does code balance their interests in privacy, safety, control, and freedom? Where does that code live?<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">To build a true competitor to Facebook or Youtube with the pro-user guarantees of free software, we needed a way to build free software that everyone can modify, that runs on our own computers, not the servers of a large business, but that balances everyone’s interests in a way people can actually trust to work as advertised.</p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">That is extremely hard to achieve. It’s a paradox. If everyone runs the software on their own computers, and it&#x27;s free software, what stops malicious users from modifying the software to do something malicious? <br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">This paradox was the subject of a lot of research through the 90s and early 2000s. But researchers never really got it working. There were file sharing networks like Bittorrent, but they had limited uses. You could create a giant cloud of files, but you needed a conventional website to find them, or at least to filter out the junk. There were “federated” protocols like email, but they depended on servers outside the user’s control, and these servers were often controlled by a large company, like Google, or if they were independently run, couldn’t be credibly considered more secure than the servers of a large corporation with a massive security team. <br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Then, in 2008, something special happened. Someone, it seemed, had come out of the woodwork with an answer to the paradox, and the answer came not just as an academic paper, but as a working app you could actually use. The “person” was Satoshi Nakamoto (though that&#x27;s definitely not his real name, and “he” might not actually have ever existed) and the project was called Bitcoin.</p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">You&#x27;ve probably heard of it, and you probably have tons of ideas about it. Like any popular phenomenon, Bitcoin has been politicized and its reputation precedes it. Maybe you got rich off Bitcoin. Maybe you lost half your life savings to it. Maybe it&#x27;s the answer to the tyranny of big banks. Maybe it&#x27;s a ponzi scheme or a “late-capitalism” acid trip from Burning Man. Bitcoin’s reputation matters much less than this fact: it was the first to crack the paradox: it was free software, it ran on our computers, and it didn’t require we trust big companies or run our own servers, like email did.<br> </p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">Bitcoin was missing one important thing though: privacy. Theoretically, anything you did there was visible to everyone in the world; they just might not know it was you. As Bitcoin grew in popularity, newer projects attempted to address this issue. Zcash was one of them. Zbay is built on Zcash. Where Facebook’s apps connect to Facebook&#x27;s servers, Zbay connects to Zcash. Where most emails go through servers controlled by Google or Microsoft, Zbay’s messages go through Zcash. Zcash itself is a network of people running Zcash nodes on computers they control. These node operators don’t need ulterior motives because—like Bitcoin—the Zcash software itself will automatically compensate them for their work to sustain the network. Most importantly, Zcash node operators don’t need to be trusted, because cryptography and economics constrain their behavior.<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">We chose Zcash as a network for Zbay for a few reasons: </p>
      <ul class="zb-essay-list">
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">It&#x27;s one of the few networks that lets us send messages privately.</li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">It aims to offer strong anonymity to message recipients and, eventually we expect, message senders.</li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">It protects metadata, that is, the record of who is speaking to who.<br></li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">Beginners can buy Zcash quickly and easily on established sites like Coinbase.</li>
        <li class="zb-essay-list-item">Its founders are pioneers in building technology for online privacy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">By building on Zcash, we can trust leading privacy-tech pioneers to protect users’ privacy, and focus on building an interface that’s easy to use. Like many eager observers of the blockchain / cryptocurrency space, we’ve felt an enormous pent-up desire for products to come along that actually matter to all of us. There as been such a breathtaking amount of investment in moonshot-like infrastructure projects to build this new stack for decentralized, peer-to-peer, free software applications. But it has produced few new useful toys for our daily lives. When do we get fun products that we can download, play with, and use with our friends to build online spaces where we’re secure, and free?<br></p>
      <p class="zb-essay-paragraph">When we saw the announcement of the encrypted memo field in Zcash, we got excited. For the first time a blockchain stack was natively supporting enough protections for user privacy to build something really useful beyond finance. We thought, “why wait for somebody else to build our dream?” We decided to go for it, and build one of the free software, peer-to-peer dream apps we’d always wished would exist—something out of a Thomas Pynchon novel: a W.A.S.T.E, or a Deep Archer. We decided to take the best big step we could in the direction of a world where our online life is controlled by the people of the Internet.<br> </p>

      <h1 data-w-id="57a5976b-66ed-76da-385d-08b82ab3d7e9" style="opacity:0" class="zb-section-heading">FAQ</h1>
      <ul class="zb-faq__faq-list">
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Should I trust Zbay to protect me against [insert specific adversary here]?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">No. Zbay, and Zcash, are experimental technologies. More generally, given the state of computer security, you should avoid using electronic means to communicate anything that could cause unacceptable harm to you if discovered.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Are direct messages private?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Direct messages you send to another user should be as private as any Zcash encrypted memo. You can learn more about Zcash encrypted memos <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/encrypted-memo-field/" class="zb-faq-link">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Are channels private?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Messages sent to a channel are as private as Zcash <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/encrypted-memo-field/" class="zb-faq-link">encrypted memos</a> and the key to that channel. Like a Bitcoin address or a Google Doc set to “anyone with the link”, the key provides full access. Unlike a Google Doc, messages on a Zcash channel can’t be deleted, so anyone with access, or anyone who controls a medium the key passes through, could potentially gain access.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Will messages be private forever?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">No. It’s likely that the discovery of bugs or advancements in cryptography (e.g. quantum cryptography) will make all or some Zbay messages public at some point in the future. That said, in an age where intelligence agencies and companies routinely scoop up data and store it forever, this is true for most encrypted communication. In channels with large numbers of people, it’s likely that one of the participants will eventually leak the key or messages themselves, to some other medium.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Can messages be deleted?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">No. If you delete your account, you will lose access to your messages. But your messages will still be accessible to recipients.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Is it anonymous?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">If someone has your Zcash address or username, you can receive messages from them anonymously if Zcash’s anonymity claims are correct. However, replying, sending messages, registering an account, or creating a public channel could reveal your IP address.</p>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Our hope is that the Zcash team will address sender anonymity in the future, and tools like VPNs or Tor may provide additional anonymity protection in the meantime.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Can third parties see who I’m talking to?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Zbay messages use Zcash shielded transactions, so sender and recipient metadata is encrypted. You can learn more about shielded transactions <a href="https://z.cash/technology/" class="zb-faq-link">here</a>.</p>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">However, there may be methods to guess who is talking to who (e.g. based on the timing of messages) or through other attacks.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Can I use Tor with Zbay?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Yes, Zbay includes basic Tor support, which lets you instruct the Zcash node to connect through Tor. However, there are important <a href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/tor.html" class="zb-faq-link">important warnings</a> about Tor support in Zcash. To use Tor, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" class="zb-faq-link">install Tor Browser</a>, run it, select the “Connect through Tor” option on startup, and make sure the proxy URL is correct.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Can I earn money with Zbay?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Yes! You can earn money by sharing Zbay with friends. It works like an affiliate code. You can send them a small amount of money (say, $1 if you like) to encourage them to install Zbay, including your address in the invitation link to receive a small percentage of what they spend, at least until they update their donation settings. (You could even send the link to a large audience, offering a larger sum of money as a prize. The first person to import the link would win the prize, and you would receive a share of whatever funds all users who accepted the invitation spend on Zbay.)</p>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">You can earn money by starting a channel. Channel owners receive small amounts of money when messages are sent to a channel, and they can set the minimum spend required for a message to be visible. This can help reduce spam, but it can also earn revenue for the channel, to support the work of moderation, for example.</p>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Finally, you can advertise and sell physical or digital goods on Zbay, too. The market is likely to be very small at first. But if you’d like to pioneer a new kind of platform, try it out. Because Zbay doesn’t have a built-in ratings system (yet) we recommend focusing on building a reputation with a small group of people as a trusted seller and working up from there.</p>
        </li>

          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Do Zbay channels have moderation?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Yes. The channel owner can appoint moderators, and moderators can hide posts, hide all posts by a certain user, ban messages to the channel from unregistered users, and set a minimum spend to message the channel.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Can moderators delete messages?</h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">No, they can only instruct the Zbay app to hide them from users. Messages cannot be deleted.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">If another Zbay user scams me, do I have any recourse?<br></h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Probably not, in the sense of recovering your funds. However, you can post about the scam in Zbay channels and on any relevant subreddits, to warn other potential victims. Channel moderators could potentially block the scam seller, also. We hope to have build a ratings system of some kind.</p>

        <li class="zb-faq__faq-item">
          <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Can I post images or other files in Zbay?<br></h2>
          <p class="zb-faq__p">Not at this time, though you may be able to post very small images or files in the future.</p>
