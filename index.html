        <p class="zb-p w-clearfix">
          <span class="zb-drop-cap">W</span>e are building Zbay because we want
          a patch of online life that's controlled by the people of the
          Internet. Not by one rich man in California, like Facebook is. Or by a
          brutal dictatorship, like WeChat and TikTok are. Or by an advertising
          company, like Youtube is.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Making such a space is really hard to do. Who makes it? Who hosts it?
          Who pays to keep it running? How does it remain controlled by the
          people, and address challenges existing spaces like Twitter or
          Facebook face, like spam or organized harassment?
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Solving these problems is hard, both technically and institutionally,
          but we must try! The alternative is a world where governments and
          corporations control our online life and the global public sphere.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Now is the perfect moment to try, because a lot of the essential
          groundwork is finally coming into existence. There is a rich and
          growing stack of technical and institutional infrastructure to build
          on:
        </p>
        <ul class="zb-num-list">
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">Free software</li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">Peer-to-peer applications</li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">Bitcoin and its successors<br /></li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            Privacy-focused blockchain networks like Zcash
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">Anonymity tools like Tor</li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">Free software governance models</li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            Moderation models and codes of conduct
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Examining each layer of this stack and how they function together
          reveals a path forward to a new online space that—as software, as a
          platform, and as a constellation of communities—is meaningfully
          controlled by the people of the Internet. We believe you can build
          communities on this stack that are more accountable, free and fair
          than communities on existing online platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          It’s amazing that we’re here and this is finally possible. A lot of
          this stuff would have been a pipe dream even a few years ago.
        </p>
        <h3 class="zb-h3">1. Free software gives users control over code.</h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Free software (sometimes called “open source software”) provides an
          established, well-understood legal and social mechanism for
          guaranteeing that people have meaningful control over the underlying
          code of the software they use.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Free software has been around for four decades (longer depending on
          how you count) so its track record of protecting the interests of
          Internet users against governments and corporate monopolies is long,
          varied and established.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          It started in the year 1980 in Cambridge, Massachusetts when, while
          fixing a broken printer, a software engineer in the bowels of an MIT
          computer lab had a powerful revelation: he realized that software
          makers had legal—and technical—power to control software users, and
          that they could use this power in nefarious ways, to extort, spy,
          censor, or worse.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          This software engineer defined what he called the "four freedoms” to
          rally software makers around a brighter future where software users
          were in control, not under control. And he called software that gave
          users these freedoms “free software.” The four freedoms were:<br />
        </p>

        <ul class="zb-num-list">
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            The freedom to run a program as you wish, for any purpose.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            The freedom to understand how a program works, and change it how you
            wish.<br />
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            The freedom to redistribute copies of a program, to help others.<br />
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            The freedom to redistribute your changes, so the wider community can
            benefit from your work.<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="zb-p">
          To protect and spread his vision for free software, he also created
          the GNU GPL, an ingenious legal contract that encoded the four
          freedoms into law. A software license, the GNU GPL gave software
          engineers a legal, contractual way to grant users and other engineers
          all four freedoms. It also required that any engineers who built on
          GNU GPL-licensed code also released <em>their </em>work under a
          similar license.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Because of this clever legal enforcement of reciprocity, the body of
          code available under the GNU GPL grew like wildfire, making possible
          so many major victories for both engineers and Internet users it’s
          impossible to even name them all.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          As with most social movements, free software’s biggest victories are
          likely invisible: dystopian futures that simply never happened. But to
          give a short list, here are some of the big ones:<br />
        </p>

        <ul class="zb-bul-list">
          <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
            Apple’s operating systems in the second Steve Jobs era were built on
            free software—at a time when it was far from certain Apple could
            challenge Microsoft’s monopoly.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
            Free software browsers and rendering engines like Firefox and Webkit
            (used by Chrome and Safari) made the Microsoft monopoly irrelevant
            by creating the web as a useful software platform.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
            Free software let people around the world watch TV and listen to
            music on their computers long before media monopolies would let
            Netflix or Spotify exist in their countries.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
            Android, an operating system built on free software, unseated
            Apple’s monopoly on the smartphone and powers 2.5 billion phones and
            tablets worldwide.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
            Free software tools are so ubiquitous in modern software development
            that young engineers take them for granted.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
            Free software let Edward Snowden and journalist Laura Poitras
            communicate privately, so they could blow the whistle on the world's
            most powerful spy agencies, the NSA and GCHQ.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="zb-p">
          With free software, any engineer can understand the code, change it,
          and distribute a competing version. This is called <em>forking</em>.
          You might not know how to code, but if a piece of free software is
          popular and doing something seriously anti-user, some irate developer
          out there will fork it for you. Free software creators know this, so
          they usually don’t bother being anti-user in the first place.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          The guarantee that you can fork code and take it in a new direction
          creates deeper collaborative dynamics, where people who contribute
          value to the project benefit from gaining some (but not total) control
          over it. After all, why would your collaborators capriciously say no
          to a good idea when they benefit from your contributions to a mutually
          beneficial project?
        </p>
        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          2. Peer-to-peer networks give users control over platforms
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Today, many modern software companies go against the interests of
          their users. Advertising is a simple example. Given the choice, most
          users would prefer to not be subjected to advertising at all, or at
          least not give advertisers their data. But popular platforms like
          Youtube, Facebook and Spotify still sell data to advertisers. If free
          software is such a powerful guarantee, how are so many prominent
          companies able to go against users’ interests?<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          The answer is simple: once free software is being run on computers we
          don’t control, most of its guarantees are moot, and that’s how
          services like Facebook, Youtube, and Spotify work. Some code runs on
          your computer or phone, but much of it runs on computers controlled by
          these companies, which you have no control over.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Because of the freedoms free software granted, companies can use
          GPL-licensed code however they choose to. As long as they don’t
          “distribute” it, they don’t have to give their users the four
          freedoms. Selling an app counts as "distributing" software, but using
          code to run a website (like Facebook.com or Google.com) does
          not.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Even worse, once Facebook and Google are running software on their
          machines, users have no control over what code is running, even if it
          is free software. Google might be using mostly free software to run
          Gmail, and you might check Gmail using a free software email client or
          web browser. But if Google decides to give the US government an easy
          way to read your emails, how would you know? That’s happening on their
          computer, not yours. If Facebook is doing something evil with your
          data, that’s running on Facebook’s computer, not yours.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          In the above cases free software might still be making the world
          better by making the marketplace more competitive, or by making it
          easier to unseat a monopoly. But for free software to provide a
          meaningful guarantee to users, users cannot depend on code running on
          computers outside their control. All of the important code needs to be
          running on a user’s own&nbsp; machine for free software’s guarantee to
          function fully.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          This is why, as more and more people used software shared by millions
          running on servers outside their control, free software had a problem.
          The free software movement's "four freedoms" only made sense when our
          apps ran on *our* computers. Once we stopped downloading apps and
          running them on our computers, and started mostly using websites like
          Facebook or Youtube, or apps dependent on company servers like
          Spotify, free software no longer provided a meaningful check on those
          companies’ power to control users.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          One way to build modern cloud services with free software is
          <em>federation</em>, but doesn’t really solve the problem, as you can
          see in the Gmail example above. Email is an example of a federated
          protocol. There are traditional servers, which can be run by anyone,
          from a big company like Google to a band of activists like
          <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup.net</a>. And there are clients
          that can connect to these servers, like Thunderbird, Outlook, the
          Gmail website, or the Mail app on an iPhone. The problem with
          federation is that you still have to trust the server, and you have no
          idea what code it’s running or who it might be working for. Google
          could give your emails to the government. The activists at Riseup
          could be hacked without your—or their—knowledge by a well-funded spy
          agency, or forced to hand over servers by a court order. Also, in
          federated platforms with many stakeholders, progress on crucial
          technical issues like privacy can stagnate because of difficulties in
          coordination and aligning priorities: the state of the art in
          end-to-end email encryption has barely made progress since the 1980s,
          for example.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Peer-to-peer networks built on free software, on the other hand,
          provide a real way to address the problem of trust. In a peer-to-peer
          network, all the important code runs (or can be run) on each
          participant’s computer. Peer-to-peer networks must by their nature be
          very untrusting of other participants in the network, since anyone out
          there could change their code to do something malicious. But if the
          network is designed to not require trust, and you’re running free
          software code on your computer, a peer-to-peer network has extended
          the guarantees of free software to the platform itself. Users can come
          together in the network knowing that they have meaningful control over
          what happens.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Peer-to-peer networks also push down the cost of forking, ensuring
          that the free software guarantee has teeth. Unlike services that
          depend on large clusters of servers, peer-to-peer networks have
          operating costs that are zero or near-zero, so forking a platform
          becomes much easier. If you had the source code to Facebook, but it
          required you to spend millions each day and assemble a massive team of
          specialists to keep it online, the code itself would not be very
          useful, and its availability would not provide a meaningful guarantee
          to users. However, because peer-to-peer networks emerge like hives
          from the code running on users’ machines, they are much easier
          platforms to fork, and the guarantee continues to be meaningful.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          3. Bitcoin showed how to do *much* more with peer-to-peer networks,
          and lowered the cost of forking even further.
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Having to not trust anyone else introduces some real limitations for
          peer-to-peer networks. In the first era of peer-to-peer applications,
          software like Limewire and Bittorrent created massive libraries of
          files and delivered them super fast, but you still needed a
          conventional website to find what you were looking for, or at least to
          filter out the junk. Even something as simple as a reliable system for
          ratings and moderation was really hard in a peer-to-peer
          context.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Unlike with desktop apps like web browsers or video players, creating
          a free software competitor to something like Facebook or Youtube is a
          much trickier proposition. These applications have to connect—and
          balance the interests of—many different users. If software runs on
          each user’s computer, how does code balance their interests in
          privacy, safety, control, and freedom?&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          To build a true online space like Facebook, Twitter or reddit with the
          pro-user guarantees of free software, we needed a way to build free
          software that everyone can modify, that runs on our own computers, not
          the servers of a large business, but that balances everyone’s
          interests in a way people can actually trust to work as
          advertised.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          That is extremely hard to achieve. It’s a paradox. If everyone runs
          the software on their own computers, and it's free software, what
          stops malicious users from modifying the software to do something
          malicious?&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          This paradox was the subject of a lot of research through the 90s and
          early 2000s. But researchers never really got it working. Sure, there
          were “federated” protocols like email or XMPP, but they depended on
          servers outside the user’s control, and these servers were often
          controlled by a large company, like Google, or if they were
          independently run, couldn’t be credibly considered more secure than
          the centralized servers of a large corporation with a massive security
          team.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Then, in 2008, something special happened. Someone, it seemed, had
          come out of the woodwork with an answer to the paradox, and the answer
          came not just as an academic paper, but as a working app you could
          actually use. The “person” was Satoshi Nakamoto, though that's
          definitely not his real name, and “he” might not actually have ever
          existed. The project was called Bitcoin.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          You've probably heard of Bitcoin, and you probably have tons of ideas
          about it. Like any popular phenomenon, Bitcoin has been politicized
          and its reputation precedes it. Maybe you got rich off Bitcoin. Maybe
          you lost half your life savings to it. Maybe it's the answer to the
          tyranny of big banks. Maybe it's a ponzi scheme or a “late-capitalism”
          acid trip from Burning Man.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Bitcoin’s reputation matters much less than this fact: it was the
          first to crack the paradox. Bitcoin was free software, and it was a
          peer-to-peer application, but it created a single agreed-upon set of
          data, known as a blockchain, that everyone could trust was correct.
          Bitcoin’s successor Ethereum took the idea even further and created a
          general platform for computation, albeit a very slow one—an almost
          magical feat.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Blockchains let you fork entire platforms and take the data with you.
          You can make a new version of the Bitcoin app that uses data on the
          same blockchain but has some new or different functionality. Or you
          can fork the blockchain code itself and give birth to a new
          blockchain, letting users carry over their accounts. You can even
          reference data on one blockchain from another. This isn’t always easy
          to do, but it’s possible and often straightforward—certainly much more
          straightforward than trying to convince Facebook to let you use their
          data to build a Facebook competitor!<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Free software gave users meaningful control over code. Peer-to-peer
          networks extended this control to the platform level, but with severe
          limitations. But Bitcoin and successors like Ethereum blew the doors
          off what kinds of applications you could practically build with a
          peer-to-peer network, and opened up the possibility for forking entire
          platforms while retaining useful data. They let us extend the
          guarantee granted by free software even farther.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          4. ZK-SNARKs and Zcash let peer-to-peer platforms keep secrets
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Bitcoin had a big missing piece: it didn’t address privacy.
          Theoretically, anything you did with Bitcoin was visible to everyone
          in the world; they just might not know it was you. But to make a
          functioning online community with things like direct messages, or an
          ecommerce platform where people provide sellers their shipping
          address, you need to be able to keep some things private.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Zcash is a Bitcoin successor with an emphasis on privacy. It lets you
          send transactions without revealing what they are or who they’re going
          to. It also includes a way to attach encrypted messages to
          transactions. If you want to build something more like Facebook,
          Twitter, or reddit on top of a blockchain, these features make Zcash a
          plausible (if clunky) place to start.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Zbay is built on the Zcash network. Where Facebook’s apps connect to
          Facebook's servers, Zbay connects to the Zcash network. Where most
          emails go through servers controlled by Google or Microsoft, Zbay’s
          messages go through the Zcash network. The Zcash network itself is
          made up of people running Zcash nodes on computers they control. Users
          don’t need to trust other Zcash node operators either, because the
          network’s design constrains their behavior.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          We chose Zcash as a network for Zbay for a few reasons:<br />
        </p>
        <ul class="zb-num-list">
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            It is one of the few networks that lets us send messages privately.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            It aims to offer strong anonymity to message recipients and,
            eventually, message senders.
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            It protects metadata, that is, the record of who is speaking to
            who.<br />
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            Beginners can buy Zcash quickly and easily on established sites like
            Coinbase.<br />
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            Its founders are pioneers in building technology for online
            privacy.<br />
          </li>
          <li class="zb-num-list-item">
            It aims to scale to billions of users and has a credible (if
            uncertain) path to doing so.<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="zb-p">
          By building on Zcash, we can trust leading privacy-tech pioneers to
          protect users’ privacy, keep them secure, and scale to billions of
          users, while we focus on building a fun app that’s easy to use and
          good for building online community.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          5. Tor protects IP addresses (and location) of users in a peer-to-peer
          platform.
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          In a peer-to-peer network like Bittorrent, Bitcoin, or even Zcash, you
          connect to many users you don’t know or trust directly from your own
          IP address, revealing it to them.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Knowing your IP address could give other users information about you
          that you’d rather not share: your employer if you’re accessing the
          network from work, your school if you’re accessing it from a campus,
          or a rough guess at your city or town if you’re accessing it from
          home.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          In this way, a peer-to-peer network can be <em>less</em> private than
          a centralized platform like Google or Facebook, where the IP address
          you connect from may be known to the services themselves, some
          intermediaries, and assorted spy agencies, but not in most cases to
          the users you’re communicating with.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          If we’re building a peer-to-peer network that people are going to use
          as an online space, we should offer at least the same level of
          protection of IP address information that Facebook and Google offer.
          Tor, a technology developed for protecting activists and journalists
          from repressive regimes, gives us one way to do that.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Tor isn’t foolproof, its efficacy when used to connect to networks
          like Bitcoin or Zcash is still the subject of research, and Tor might
          actually make these networks
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6079">less secure</a> in some
          ways. But it restores the privacy protections for your IP address when
          you use a peer-to-peer platform instead of a centralized one, so we
          think it’s an important part of the stack, at least until the Zcash
          team addresses this privacy problem directly.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          6. Free software has established models for governance.
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          The ability to fork a free software project and build in a new
          direction is a powerful guarantee that over time the software will
          serve its users, but if a free software project is governed in a way
          that is responsive to its users’ and developers’ needs, forking might
          never be necessary. Zbay will strive to find a governance model that
          can align our interests with users, minimizing the necessity of
          forking.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Some free software projects are run by a conventional business. Others
          are run by foundations like the
          <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, the
          nonprofit organization behind the Firefox browser, or the
          <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a>, the nonprofit
          organization that makes the privacy and anonymity tool Tor. Others,
          including many of the basic building blocks of the Internet itself,
          are run through rough consensus of volunteers and paid professionals
          spanning dozens of organizations and companies.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          There are lots of models that make sense and huge troves of experience
          to draw from in deciding how to govern Zbay. Right now, Zbay is still
          just an experiment, so settling on a governance model would be putting
          the cart before the horse, especially given that—if we failed to find
          a good one—forking would always be an option. Nonprofit foundations
          are difficult enough to start and maintain that they aren’t the best
          default starting point for a small free software project. But we do
          have experience starting and operating them (we participated in
          founding
          <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">fightforthefuture.org</a>
          and <a href="https://pculture.org/">pculture.org</a>) if that seems
          like the best path forward.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          There are new structures emerging each year. A
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)"
            >B Corporation</a
          >
          is newer kind of entity that combines the structure of a conventional
          corporation with the declared public interest mission of a nonprofit.
          A
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application"
            >DApp</a
          >
          is a piece of autonomous software that can elect decision-makers,
          approve or reject major proposals, or possibly even approve or reject
          proposed code changes based on a voting algorithm. Peer-to-peer
          networks governed by peer-to-peer networks. Yikes!<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Finally, the network that Zbay uses, Zcash, has its own structures for
          governance. If you like, you can read more about Zcash’s own
          <a href="https://www.zfnd.org/governance/">governance structure</a
          >—the people behind Zcash are putting a ton of thought and work into
          this.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">7. Moderation models and codes of conduct</h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Online spaces aren’t just about how they’re built; the culture and
          community that develop on them are the final piece that matters more
          than anything. With Zbay, we believe that we can stand against
          censorship while still building online communities that are safe,
          respectful, and accountable to the values of diverse communities.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Zbay will soon include established systems for moderation, where
          channel owners can hide posts, ignore problem users, or delegate these
          powers to moderators. Channel owners will have the power they need to
          create functioning online communities built on respect for clear
          principles. Zbay will encourage channel owners to post clear codes of
          conduct that moderators will enforce consistently, and we plan to
          recommend model codes of conduct.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          That said, channel owners have complete freedom to decide the rules
          for their channel, and the fact that Zbay is a free software,
          peer-to-peer, blockchain-based platform guarantees they always will.
          First, the Zcash blockchain is designed for censorship resistance. You
          can't simply delete transactions or messages. When channel owners
          “hide” a message on Zbay, they are sending a new message which tells
          the Zbay app to ignore it. The hidden message is still there, and
          users could modify their Zbay app to display it. If the Zbay team
          added censorship code, an anti-censorship fork could remove it, and no
          human expression would be lost.&nbsp;<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Unlike platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and reddit, users won’t be
          bombarded by an algorithm serving messages from communities users did
          not choose to participate in. Zbay users are not subject to the
          content of Zbay channels unwillingly: they must actively join them and
          can leave at any time.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          The Zbay team believes that it is morally wrong—and harmful to any
          conceivable notion of political progress—to censor channel owners. Any
          destructive conversation is certain to be outweighed by a larger,
          countervailing, constructive response. The response could come in that
          conversation itself or in other conversations on Zbay, elsewhere on
          the Internet, or years down the road—but it will come: the arc of the
          moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Our commitment to
          this idea is unshakeable, and thanks to the technology we’re building
          on, you don’t even need to take our word for it.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">Fitting it all together</h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          If our goal is to make a patch of online life that’s controlled by the
          people of the Internet, not by big companies or repressive
          governments, we can fit these pieces together to achieve that in Zbay.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Zbay exists as free software available under the GNU GPL. Even if the
          organization and team we’ve created to make Zbay disappears, others
          will be able to take the code and continue. Any developer in the world
          can make improvements to Zbay, and if the Zbay team doesn’t accept
          these improvements, that developer can create their own alternative.
          This guarantees that the people of the Internet will control Zbay’s
          underlying code.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Zbay is peer-to-peer, so Zbay as a platform emerges hive-like when
          many users run the code of the Zbay app. If the code survives, the
          platform survives as well. If developers with a new and better vision
          want to fork the code, they can fork the platform as well. Thanks to
          Zbay being a peer-to-peer network, the control users enjoy over code
          also gives them meaningful control over the platform.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Because Zbay uses a blockchain, it can do some special things that
          used to not be possible in peer-to-peer networks, like registering
          unique usernames or channel names, sending money, and buying or
          selling things. This also lets Zbay use small fees to increase the
          cost of being a bad actor—for example by registering millions of fake
          accounts, sending spam, or scamming other users. Using a blockchain
          network guarantees that competing projects will be able to take
          essential data (like channels, users, and their messages) with them
          when they fork, without needing permission from the team behind
          Zbay&mdash;in stark contrast to centralized services like Facebook,
          where big companies use control over data to lock users and developers
          into the network.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Zbay uses the cutting-edge, privacy-focused blockchain Zcash, so it
          can offer basic privacy protections like end-to-end encryption for
          direct messages and group chats. It can even protect “metadata,”
          knowledge of who is speaking with whom. Zbay also uses Tor (optionally
          right now) to protect users’ IP address from becoming public,
          restoring a basic privacy protection offered by centralized services.
          Unlike a centralized service like Facebook, where privacy guarantees
          are based just on what Facebook <em>says</em> it will do, and
          potentially undermined by laws that require it to collaborate with
          governments in secret, the privacy guarantees in Zbay are based in
          encryption, free software, and peer-to-peer networks which can
          (someday) be studied by researchers and verified to be secure against
          all known attacks.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Zbay has a deep trove of free software governance models to choose
          from, as well as new kinds of entities like the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)"
            >B Corporation</a
          >
          or the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application"
            >DApp</a
          >. The Zcash network on which Zbay is built has a thoughtful and
          evolving governance model. The low cost of forking a free software,
          peer-to-peer, blockchain-based platform creates a baseline guarantee
          that the platform will serve users’ interests. But a good governance
          model can do even better: it can actively solicit and respond to user
          and developer feedback and make smart plans for the future.

        <h3 class="zb-h3">What are we waiting for?</h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Like many eager observers of the blockchain / cryptocurrency space,
          we’ve felt an enormous pent-up desire for products to come along that
          actually matter to all of us. We saw the first peer-to-peer platforms
          emerge in the early 2000s. We saw Bitcoin and Ethereum emerge years
          later. We watched as a breathtaking amount of investment flowed into
          moonshot-like infrastructure projects to build this new stack for
          decentralized, peer-to-peer, free software applications.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Still, we’ve felt some pent-up frustration that all this investment
          and passion has produced so few useful tools for our daily lives. When
          do us Internet users get fun products that we can download, play with,
          and use with our friends to build online spaces where people are
          secure and free?
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          When we saw the announcement of the encrypted memo field in Zcash, we
          got excited. For the first time a blockchain stack was natively
          supporting enough protections for user privacy to build something
          really useful beyond finance. We thought, “why wait for somebody else
          to build our dream?” We decided to go for it, and build one of the
          free software, peer-to-peer dream apps we’d always wished would
          exist—something out of a Thomas Pynchon novel: a W.A.S.T.E, or a
          DeepArcher.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          We decided to take the best big step we could in the direction of a
          world where our online life is controlled by the people of the
          Internet. We built Zbay.

          How Zbay works
        </h2>
        <p class="zb-p w-clearfix">
          <span class="zb-drop-cap">Z</span>bay is a Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux
          desktop app that uses encrypted memos sent over the Zcash network to
          build an experience like Slack, Telegram, or Facebook Marketplace. You
          can register a username, message other users, join channels (group
          chats), offer items for sale, and buy things—all over the Zcash
          network. There’s no central server.
        </p>
        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          Zbay uses Zcash shielded transactions and encrypted memos for
          everything
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          What makes Zcash different from Bitcoin or Ethereum is that it has
          shielded transactions. Shielded transactions can include tiny
          encrypted memos, which only the recipient can see. The cost per
          message is very low: penny can send more than a hundred messages. (So
          we automatically send every Zbay user a small amount of the Zcash
          currency, ZEC, to get them started.)
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          An encrypted memo allows a maximum of just 512 characters, but Zbay
          squeezes a lot of interesting stuff into it. If you message another
          user, we send a transaction with a tiny amount of ZEC and an encrypted
          memo containing the contents of your message and your signature.
          (Zcash includes no information about the sender of a message, so we
          have to include your signature so that the recipient will know it's
          you!)
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          If you message a group of users, we send the exact same kind of
          message to one address, but everyone in the group has the key to read
          messages sent to that address. That's what lets you into the group:
          knowing the address to send to and having the key to read all the
          messages sent there. Zcash has separate keys for viewing and spending,
          so just because you can read messages doesn't mean you can spend money
          sent to the channel—only the user can do that. Unfortunately, there is
          no way to know who has joined the group, or to remove someone from the
          group. Access control for channels is very crude for now, but it works
          and is a starting point.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          Zbay has secure, human-readable usernames and channels
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Since Zbay can send encrypted messages to other addresses, share
          access to these addresses, and use the contents of these messages
          however it likes, it can offer familiar experiences like having a
          username and being able to message people with usernames, without
          smart contracts. The data live in the blockchain, but the smarts, for
          now, live in the Zbay app.
        </p>
        <p class="zb-p">
          If you register a username, we send a message to an address that
          <em>everyone</em> has the viewing key for. The message says "I hereby
          register the username @alice, this is my address, and this is my
          public key." And it's sent to a special address that's hardcoded into
          the Zbay app. (Soon you will be able to register multiple usernames
          and switch between them, but right now you can only have one.)<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          We do the same thing when you make a channel public. ("I hereby
          register the channel #bears, this is its address, and this is its
          viewing key.") The Zbay app can see all the channel registration
          messages sent to this address and give users a nice searchable list,
          or make the channel #bears a clickable link if someone mentions it in
          a message.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">Zbay has moderation</h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Anyone can send a message to any address they know about, but Zbay can
          decide which messages it displays and which it ignores, and you can
          control this. If someone starts spamming you, you can block them and
          Zbay will recieve their messages but hide them from you. If spam
          becomes a problem we might start charging people more money to create
          accounts, or charging them to send a first message to someone else.
          (Each user could register the minimum spend to contact them for the
          first time.)<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Channel owners can moderate by sending special messages to a channel
          that tell the Zbay app to ignore a specific message or a problem user.
          Of course, if channel participants don't like this they can always
          move to another channel, so channel owners must tread carefully in how
          they conduct moderation.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="zb-p">
          Users can even offer items for sale. An offer is a normal message with
          some special information that Zbay parses to show an ad-like blurb in
          the channel. Users can message the seller with questions, buy the
          product, and even include their shipping information in a convenient
          way. All of this is sent directly to the seller in an encrypted
          message. Someday, channel owners will be able to set a minimum price
          for posting an offer to a channel.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          Zbay uses encryption, not deletion, to protect privacy
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Messages never get deleted, but deletion may be overrated, or at least
          much more difficult in practice than it seems. According to the
          Snowden leaks, America’s NSA is saving a permanent copy of all
          messages that travel across the Internet. Other countries likely are
          too. In purely technical terms, when you delete something, whether on
          a centralized service like Facebook or even on your own computer, it’s
          hard to be sure it was deleted. Some peer-to-peer networks make
          deletion of messages the norm, but on a peer-to-peer network any
          participant with a modified app—from the NSA to a sleazy data
          collection business—can save every message they see, forever. As
          Edward Snowden explains in his book
          <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record"
            >Permanent Record</a
          >, the best way to keep things private is to encrypt information and
          control the keys, not to rely on deletion.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="zb-h3">
          Zbay can be used with Tor or VPNs for greater anonymity
        </h3>
        <p class="zb-p">
          Finally, there's an important caveat when it comes to anonymity: even
          though information about the sender of a message is hidden from folks
          viewing the blockchain, peers on the Zcash network can see the IP
          addresses of other peers as they post transactions. An attacker could
          join the network with a lot of peers and then associate transactions
          (like messages registering a username) to an IP address. This isn't
          especially expensive. So it could be a good idea to use Zbay over a
          VPN, Tor, or both if you want increased anonymity, though you should
          understand the limits of those approaches and the risks too!<br />

              No. Zbay, and Zcash, are experimental technologies. More
              generally, given the state of computer security, you should avoid
              using electronic means to communicate anything that could cause
              unacceptable harm to you if discovered.

              Direct messages you send to another user should be as private as

              and the viewing key to that channel. Like a Bitcoin address or a
              Google Doc set to “anyone with the link”, the key provides full
              access. Unlike a Google Doc, messages on a Zcash channel can’t be
              deleted, so anyone with access, or anyone who controls a medium
              the key passes through, could potentially access all messages sent
              to that channel forever.

            <h2 class="zb-faq__question">Will messages be private forever?</h2>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              No. In channels with large numbers of people, it’s likely that one
              of the participants will eventually leak the key or messages
              themselves, to some other medium. Even if the key is kept secure,
              it’s likely that the discovery of bugs or advancements in
              cryptography (e.g. quantum cryptography) will make all or some
              Zbay messages public at some point in the future. That said, in an
              age where intelligence agencies and companies routinely scoop up
              data and store it forever, this is true for most encrypted
              communication.

              messages and funds from them without revealing your IP address or
              identity, if Zcash’s anonymity claims are correct. (Note that your
              IP address would be visible as a Zcash or perhaps Zbay user, and
              there may not be many of those.) On the other hand, replying,
              sending messages, registering an account, or creating a public
              channel could reveal your IP address to an attacker who was
              actively monitoring the Zcash network at that moment.

              Our hope is that the Zcash team will address sender anonymity in

              Yes! You can earn money by sharing Zbay with friends. It works
              like an affiliate code. You can send them a small amount of money
              (say, $1 if you like) to encourage them to install Zbay, including
              your address in the invitation link to receive a small percentage
              of what they spend, at least until they update their donation
              settings. (You could even send the link to a large audience,
              offering a larger sum of money as a prize. The first person to
              import the link would win the prize, and you would receive a share

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              You can earn money by starting a channel. Channel owners receive
              small amounts of money when messages are sent to a channel, and
              they can set the minimum spend required for a message to be
              visible. This can help reduce spam, but it can also earn revenue
              for the channel, to support the work of moderation, for example.

              Finally, you can advertise and sell physical or digital goods on
              Zbay, too. The market is likely to be very small at first. But if
              you’d like to pioneer a new kind of platform, try it out. Because
              Zbay doesn’t have a built-in ratings system (yet) we recommend
              focusing on building a reputation with a small group of people as
              a trusted seller and working up from there.

              Yes. The channel owner can appoint moderators, and moderators can
              hide posts, hide all posts by a certain user, ban messages to the
              channel from unregistered users, and set a minimum spend to

              Probably not, in the sense of recovering your funds. However, you
              can post about the scam in Zbay channels and on any relevant

              What is Zbay’s carbon footprint? Will it destroy the planet?<br />
            </h2>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              An October 2019
              <a
                href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-proposal-carbon-offsetting/34834/6"
                >estimate</a
              >
              of the Zcash network’s carbon footprint estimated that it used the
              equivalent of 7.09 American households per year. So at the moment
              it will not destroy the planet, no!
            </p>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              This footprint could grow in the future if the price of Zcash
              increases. It could also decrease as the Zcash network becomes
              more efficient by introducing things like proof of stake, as
              renewables become cheaper or more prevalent in China (where most
              cryptocurrency mining happens), as carbon taxes spread in
              prevalence, or due to other factors.
            </p>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              According to the same estimate above, offsetting the carbon
              emissions of the Zcash network would cost $5,000/year, which is
              pretty manageable.

              How many people will be able to use Zbay?<br />
            </h2>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              Right now, not that many! The Zcash network can process about 6
              “transactions” per second. Zbay can potentially fit a few short
              messages into a single transaction, so let’s say it can handle 10
              messages per second. If Zbay quickly grows in popularity, it could
              become less reliable or even unusable.
            </p>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              There are many ways Zbay could put less of a burden on the Zcash
              network. Meanwhile, the Zcash team seems intent on making the
              Zcash network scale to billions of users, and has a credible path
              towards doing so. So it could be that, by the time Zbay becomes
              popular, the Zcash network is no longer a bottleneck.

            </h2>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              (TL;DR: Even if Zbay pursues state-of-the-art approaches to
              protect users’ privacy, which it has a moral obligation to do,
              that will not stop well-resourced law-enforcement institutions
              from subverting or working around these protections to enforce the
              law, which is as it should be. In short, we take the same position
              that Apple has taken in their design of the iPhone.)
            </p>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              This question is important and deserves a complete answer, so this
              section is itself a mini-essay on the state of technology,
              democracy, and power.&nbsp;<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              First, unlike with centralized services, all of the basic data
              necessary to hold lawbreaking users and channel owners accountable
              will be equally available to everyone on the Internet. If anyone
              is considering using Zbay to break the law, this fact should give
              them pause. While Zbay seeks to protect the privacy of its users,
              the current state of cybersecurity is such that it is always
              possible, even against the most advanced privacy and anonymity
              tools, to identify and disrupt those seen as bad actors, given
              sufficient resources. Unlike with cloud platforms like Facebook,
              agencies and researchers will not need special privileges to
              access the data they need; it will all be in the open to everyone,
              to the extent it is to anyone.<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              Perhaps the best example of how technology can be as secure and
              private as possible while still leaving room for law enforcement
              is the iPhone. Apple provides the best encryption they can for
              every iPhone, to protect their customers’ photos, messages, and
              online accounts if a phone is lost or stolen. When, to investigate
              a terrorist attack, the FBI demanded Apple change this code to let
              them access a seized iPhone, Apple famously stood firm and
              refused. Apple argued that this “back door” would undermine the
              privacy and security of all their customers, including
              journalists, world leaders, and engineers maintaining critical
              infrastructure—which would in turn undermine
              <em>everyone’s</em> safety. Soon after, the FBI revealed that it
              had contracted a highly specialized service that, despite Apple’s
              best efforts, was able to break the security protecting the seized
              iPhone. This is hardly an isolated case: time and again, when
              products have used encryption to protect privacy, law enforcement
              agencies complain loudly about their imminent powerlessness
              against scary adversaries, while quietly mustering their abundant
              resources to break through technical barriers and bring the most
              technically-savvy bad actors to justice.&nbsp;<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              Zbay will go as far as it can to protect users’ privacy and
              anonymity. If governments want to spy on conversations or identify
              users they might need to go to great lengths to do so. It might be
              hard, and that’s okay: violating peoples’ privacy in a democracy
              is <em>supposed</em> to be hard.&nbsp;<br />
            </p>
            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              Unlike centralized services, the Zbay team will not hold any
              useful data or be a gatekeeper to their ability to do this, and no
              government will have privileged access to user data on Zbay simply
              because they are the home jurisdiction of the company. In a world
              where communication happens on peer-to-peer platforms like Zbay,
              countries and organizations with advanced offensive hacking and
              surveillance capabilities will enjoy an advantage when it comes to
              data collection and enforcement against unlawful behavior. However
              they will have to choose their targets carefully, since any
              methods used to enforce the law could also be used by bad actors
              against legitimate users once widely known. (Which means the Zbay
              platform or Zcash network will have a basic duty to its users to
              fix these privacy problems once they are discovered.)&nbsp;<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              This pattern places a strong limit on mass surveillance while,
              given the ever imperfect state of cybersecurity, providing law
              enforcement with ample options for enforcing against antisocial
              behavior in important cases.<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              We believe that law enforcement by public institutions rooted in
              democracy—not rules created by private platforms—is the correct
              way to hold online communities and their participants accountable
              for their behavior. Right now, governments and shareholders are
              pressuring large online platforms to arbitrarily create their own
              private rules, outside the representation guarantees of democratic
              structures. This is wrong: democracies should not abdicate their
              role and give unaccountable private power total control over what
              people can and cannot say online. Instead, democracies should
              create clear, consistent standards that protect free expression
              and create public institutions capable of enforcing these
              principles directly against their most destructive offenders. Zbay
              is completely compatible with this vision.<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              At the same time, every online platform exists in a global reality
              where some governments are sometimes corrupt, unrepresentative,
              violent, and repressive. So we must create platforms that give
              ordinary people the power to resist their local laws, speak truth
              to power, and—even with the best privacy and anonymity tools when
              working against well-resourced adversaries like governments—risk
              getting caught.&nbsp;<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              After all, accountability between law and online discussion runs
              in two directions: for residents of democracies to hold each other
              accountable, they need to be able to enforce the law—but for
              residents of non-democracies to hold each other accountable, they
              need to somehow hold their authoritarian governments accountable,
              which means being able to break the law. One can say this isn’t
              the way things should be, but it is the way things are now: much
              of the world is not governed by democracy. This stark fact means
              that everyone who cares about democracy must agree governments
              need strong checks—as strong as we can make them—on their power to
              control what people do online.<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              We believe that all of us—especially those of us who enjoy the
              benefits of democracy—owe residents of repressive countries the
              best protections for privacy we can practically muster, so that in
              pivotal moments they can gather in courage and make their voices
              heard.<br />
            </p>

            <p class="zb-faq__p">
              This belief doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It emerges from a
              centuries-old discussion on the value of freedom of expression,
              and is surrounded right now by an ever-accelerating debate pushed
              forward by a dizzying barrage of terrifying news and political
              events. We recognize that not all the answers will be visible
              right now, but we hope that by launching Zbay into the world, we
              can dig deeper down, past the first wave of superficial responses,
              down to some thoughtful and robust answer that can last. We
              welcome and treasure the conversation.<br />
