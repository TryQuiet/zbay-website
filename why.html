        ⚠️ Zbay is no longer maintained. We are now building <a href="https://tryquiet.org">Quiet</a>, a Tor-based alternative to Slack & Discord that doesn't rely on servers. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1 class="zb-section-heading">Why we're building Zbay</h1>
      <p class="zb-p w-clearfix">
        <span class="zb-drop-cap">W</span>e are building Zbay because we want
        a patch of online life that's controlled by the people of the
        Internet. Not by one rich man in California, like Facebook is. Or by a
        brutal dictatorship, like WeChat and TikTok are. Or by an advertising
        company, like Youtube is.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Making such a space is really hard to do. Who makes it? Who hosts it?
        Who pays to keep it running? How does it remain controlled by the
        people, and address challenges existing spaces like Twitter or
        Facebook face, like spam or organized harassment?
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Solving these problems is hard, both technically and institutionally,
        but we must try! The alternative is a world where governments and
        corporations control our online life and the global public sphere.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Now is the perfect moment to try, because a lot of the essential
        groundwork is finally coming into existence. There is a rich and
        growing stack of technical and institutional infrastructure to build
        on:
      </p>
      <ul class="zb-num-list">
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">Free software</li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">Peer-to-peer applications</li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">Bitcoin and its successors<br /></li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          Privacy-focused blockchain networks like Zcash
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">Anonymity tools like Tor</li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">Free software governance models</li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          Moderation models and codes of conduct
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Examining each layer of this stack and how they function together
        reveals a path forward to a new online space that—as software, as a
        platform, and as a constellation of communities—is meaningfully
        controlled by the people of the Internet. We believe you can build
        communities on this stack that are more accountable, free and fair
        than communities on existing online platforms.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        It’s amazing that we’re here and this is finally possible. A lot of
        this stuff would have been a pipe dream even a few years ago.
      </p>
      <h3 class="zb-h3">1. Free software gives users control over code.</h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Free software (sometimes called “open source software”) provides an
        established, well-understood legal and social mechanism for
        guaranteeing that people have meaningful control over the underlying
        code of the software they use.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Free software has been around for four decades (longer depending on
        how you count) so its track record of protecting the interests of
        Internet users against governments and corporate monopolies is long,
        varied and established.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        It started in the year 1980 in Cambridge, Massachusetts when, while
        fixing a broken printer, a software engineer in the bowels of an MIT
        computer lab had a powerful revelation: he realized that software
        makers had legal—and technical—power to control software users, and
        that they could use this power in nefarious ways, to extort, spy,
        censor, or worse.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        This software engineer defined what he called the "four freedoms” to
        rally software makers around a brighter future where software users
        were in control, not under control. And he called software that gave
        users these freedoms “free software.” The four freedoms were:<br />
      </p>

      <ul class="zb-num-list">
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          The freedom to run a program as you wish, for any purpose.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          The freedom to understand how a program works, and change it how you
          wish.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          The freedom to redistribute copies of a program, to help others.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          The freedom to redistribute your changes, so the wider community can
          benefit from your work.<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="zb-p">
        To protect and spread his vision for free software, he also created
        the GNU GPL, an ingenious legal contract that encoded the four
        freedoms into law. A software license, the GNU GPL gave software
        engineers a legal, contractual way to grant users and other engineers
        all four freedoms. It also required that any engineers who built on
        GNU GPL-licensed code also released <em>their </em>work under a
        similar license.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Because of this clever legal enforcement of reciprocity, the body of
        code available under the GNU GPL grew like wildfire, making possible
        so many major victories for both engineers and Internet users it’s
        impossible to even name them all.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        As with most social movements, free software’s biggest victories are
        likely invisible: dystopian futures that simply never happened. But to
        give a short list, here are some of the big ones:<br />
      </p>

      <ul class="zb-bul-list">
        <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
          Apple’s operating systems in the second Steve Jobs era were built on
          free software—at a time when it was far from certain Apple could
          challenge Microsoft’s monopoly.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
          Free software browsers and rendering engines like Firefox and Webkit
          (used by Chrome and Safari) made the Microsoft monopoly irrelevant
          by creating the web as a useful software platform.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
          Free software let people around the world watch TV and listen to
          music on their computers long before media monopolies would let
          Netflix or Spotify exist in their countries.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
          Android, an operating system built on free software, unseated
          Apple’s monopoly on the smartphone and powers 2.5 billion phones and
          tablets worldwide.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
          Free software tools are so ubiquitous in modern software development
          that young engineers take them for granted.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-bul-list-item">
          Free software let Edward Snowden and journalist Laura Poitras
          communicate privately, so they could blow the whistle on the world's
          most powerful spy agencies, the NSA and GCHQ.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="zb-p">
        With free software, any engineer can understand the code, change it,
        and distribute a competing version. This is called <em>forking</em>.
        You might not know how to code, but if a piece of free software is
        popular and doing something seriously anti-user, some irate developer
        out there will fork it for you. Free software creators know this, so
        they usually don’t bother being anti-user in the first place.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        The guarantee that you can fork code and take it in a new direction
        creates deeper collaborative dynamics, where people who contribute
        value to the project benefit from gaining some (but not total) control
        over it. After all, why would your collaborators capriciously say no
        to a good idea when they benefit from your contributions to a mutually
        beneficial project?
      </p>
      <h3 class="zb-h3">
        2. Peer-to-peer networks give users control over platforms
      </h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Today, many modern software companies go against the interests of
        their users. Advertising is a simple example. Given the choice, most
        users would prefer to not be subjected to advertising at all, or at
        least not give advertisers their data. But popular platforms like
        Youtube, Facebook and Spotify still sell data to advertisers. If free
        software is such a powerful guarantee, how are so many prominent
        companies able to go against users’ interests?<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        The answer is simple: once free software is being run on computers we
        don’t control, most of its guarantees are moot, and that’s how
        services like Facebook, Youtube, and Spotify work. Some code runs on
        your computer or phone, but much of it runs on computers controlled by
        these companies, which you have no control over.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Because of the freedoms free software granted, companies can use
        GPL-licensed code however they choose to. As long as they don’t
        “distribute” it, they don’t have to give their users the four
        freedoms. Selling an app counts as "distributing" software, but using
        code to run a website (like Facebook.com or Google.com) does
        not.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Even worse, once Facebook and Google are running software on their
        machines, users have no control over what code is running, even if it
        is free software. Google might be using mostly free software to run
        Gmail, and you might check Gmail using a free software email client or
        web browser. But if Google decides to give the US government an easy
        way to read your emails, how would you know? That’s happening on their
        computer, not yours. If Facebook is doing something evil with your
        data, that’s running on Facebook’s computer, not yours.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        In the above cases free software might still be making the world
        better by making the marketplace more competitive, or by making it
        easier to unseat a monopoly. But for free software to provide a
        meaningful guarantee to users, users cannot depend on code running on
        computers outside their control. All of the important code needs to be
        running on a user’s own&nbsp; machine for free software’s guarantee to
        function fully.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        This is why, as more and more people used software shared by millions
        running on servers outside their control, free software had a problem.
        The free software movement's "four freedoms" only made sense when our
        apps ran on *our* computers. Once we stopped downloading apps and
        running them on our computers, and started mostly using websites like
        Facebook or Youtube, or apps dependent on company servers like
        Spotify, free software no longer provided a meaningful check on those
        companies’ power to control users.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        One way to build modern cloud services with free software is
        <em>federation</em>, but doesn’t really solve the problem, as you can
        see in the Gmail example above. Email is an example of a federated
        protocol. There are traditional servers, which can be run by anyone,
        from a big company like Google to a band of activists like
        <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup.net</a>. And there are clients
        that can connect to these servers, like Thunderbird, Outlook, the
        Gmail website, or the Mail app on an iPhone. The problem with
        federation is that you still have to trust the server, and you have no
        idea what code it’s running or who it might be working for. Google
        could give your emails to the government. The activists at Riseup
        could be hacked without your—or their—knowledge by a well-funded spy
        agency, or forced to hand over servers by a court order. Also, in
        federated platforms with many stakeholders, progress on crucial
        technical issues like privacy can stagnate because of difficulties in
        coordination and aligning priorities: the state of the art in
        end-to-end email encryption has barely made progress since the 1980s,
        for example.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Peer-to-peer networks built on free software, on the other hand,
        provide a real way to address the problem of trust. In a peer-to-peer
        network, all the important code runs (or can be run) on each
        participant’s computer. Peer-to-peer networks must by their nature be
        very untrusting of other participants in the network, since anyone out
        there could change their code to do something malicious. But if the
        network is designed to not require trust, and you’re running free
        software code on your computer, a peer-to-peer network has extended
        the guarantees of free software to the platform itself. Users can come
        together in the network knowing that they have meaningful control over
        what happens.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Peer-to-peer networks also push down the cost of forking, ensuring
        that the free software guarantee has teeth. Unlike services that
        depend on large clusters of servers, peer-to-peer networks have
        operating costs that are zero or near-zero, so forking a platform
        becomes much easier. If you had the source code to Facebook, but it
        required you to spend millions each day and assemble a massive team of
        specialists to keep it online, the code itself would not be very
        useful, and its availability would not provide a meaningful guarantee
        to users. However, because peer-to-peer networks emerge like hives
        from the code running on users’ machines, they are much easier
        platforms to fork, and the guarantee continues to be meaningful.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="zb-h3">
        3. Bitcoin showed how to do *much* more with peer-to-peer networks,
        and lowered the cost of forking even further.
      </h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Having to not trust anyone else introduces some real limitations for
        peer-to-peer networks. In the first era of peer-to-peer applications,
        software like Limewire and Bittorrent created massive libraries of
        files and delivered them super fast, but you still needed a
        conventional website to find what you were looking for, or at least to
        filter out the junk. Even something as simple as a reliable system for
        ratings and moderation was really hard in a peer-to-peer
        context.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Unlike with desktop apps like web browsers or video players, creating
        a free software competitor to something like Facebook or Youtube is a
        much trickier proposition. These applications have to connect—and
        balance the interests of—many different users. If software runs on
        each user’s computer, how does code balance their interests in
        privacy, safety, control, and freedom?&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        To build a true online space like Facebook, Twitter or reddit with the
        pro-user guarantees of free software, we needed a way to build free
        software that everyone can modify, that runs on our own computers, not
        the servers of a large business, but that balances everyone’s
        interests in a way people can actually trust to work as
        advertised.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        That is extremely hard to achieve. It’s a paradox. If everyone runs
        the software on their own computers, and it's free software, what
        stops malicious users from modifying the software to do something
        malicious?&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        This paradox was the subject of a lot of research through the 90s and
        early 2000s. But researchers never really got it working. Sure, there
        were “federated” protocols like email or XMPP, but they depended on
        servers outside the user’s control, and these servers were often
        controlled by a large company, like Google, or if they were
        independently run, couldn’t be credibly considered more secure than
        the centralized servers of a large corporation with a massive security
        team.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Then, in 2008, something special happened. Someone, it seemed, had
        come out of the woodwork with an answer to the paradox, and the answer
        came not just as an academic paper, but as a working app you could
        actually use. The “person” was Satoshi Nakamoto, though that's
        definitely not his real name, and “he” might not actually have ever
        existed. The project was called Bitcoin.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        You've probably heard of Bitcoin, and you probably have tons of ideas
        about it. Like any popular phenomenon, Bitcoin has been politicized
        and its reputation precedes it. Maybe you got rich off Bitcoin. Maybe
        you lost half your life savings to it. Maybe it's the answer to the
        tyranny of big banks. Maybe it's a ponzi scheme or a “late-capitalism”
        acid trip from Burning Man.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Bitcoin’s reputation matters much less than this fact: it was the
        first to crack the paradox. Bitcoin was free software, and it was a
        peer-to-peer application, but it created a single agreed-upon set of
        data, known as a blockchain, that everyone could trust was correct.
        Bitcoin’s successor Ethereum took the idea even further and created a
        general platform for computation, albeit a very slow one—an almost
        magical feat.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Blockchains let you fork entire platforms and take the data with you.
        You can make a new version of the Bitcoin app that uses data on the
        same blockchain but has some new or different functionality. Or you
        can fork the blockchain code itself and give birth to a new
        blockchain, letting users carry over their accounts. You can even
        reference data on one blockchain from another. This isn’t always easy
        to do, but it’s possible and often straightforward—certainly much more
        straightforward than trying to convince Facebook to let you use their
        data to build a Facebook competitor!<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Free software gave users meaningful control over code. Peer-to-peer
        networks extended this control to the platform level, but with severe
        limitations. But Bitcoin and successors like Ethereum blew the doors
        off what kinds of applications you could practically build with a
        peer-to-peer network, and opened up the possibility for forking entire
        platforms while retaining useful data. They let us extend the
        guarantee granted by free software even farther.<br />
      </p>

      </h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Bitcoin had a big missing piece: it didn’t address privacy.
        Theoretically, anything you did with Bitcoin was visible to everyone
        in the world; they just might not know it was you. But to make a
        functioning online community with things like direct messages, or an
        ecommerce platform where people provide sellers their shipping
        address, you need to be able to keep some things private.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Zcash is a Bitcoin successor with an emphasis on privacy. It lets you
        send transactions without revealing what they are or who they’re going
        to. It also includes a way to attach encrypted messages to
        transactions. If you want to build something more like Facebook,
        Twitter, or reddit on top of a blockchain, these features make Zcash a
        plausible (if clunky) place to start.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Zbay is built on the Zcash network. Where Facebook’s apps connect to
        Facebook's servers, Zbay connects to the Zcash network. Where most
        emails go through servers controlled by Google or Microsoft, Zbay’s
        messages go through the Zcash network. The Zcash network itself is
        made up of people running Zcash nodes on computers they control. Users
        don’t need to trust other Zcash node operators either, because the
        network’s design constrains their behavior.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        We chose Zcash as a network for Zbay for a few reasons:<br />
      </p>
      <ul class="zb-num-list">
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          It is one of the few networks that lets us send messages privately.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          It aims to offer strong anonymity to message recipients and,
          eventually, message senders.
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          It protects metadata, that is, the record of who is speaking to
          who.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          Beginners can buy Zcash quickly and easily on established sites like
          Coinbase.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          Its founders are pioneers in building technology for online
          privacy.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="zb-num-list-item">
          It aims to scale to billions of users and has a credible (if
          uncertain) path to doing so.<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="zb-p">
        By building on Zcash, we can trust leading privacy-tech pioneers to
        protect users’ privacy, keep them secure, and scale to billions of
        users, while we focus on building a fun app that’s easy to use and
        good for building online community.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="zb-h3">
        5. Tor protects IP addresses (and location) of users in a peer-to-peer
        platform.
      </h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        In a peer-to-peer network like Bittorrent, Bitcoin, or even Zcash, you
        connect to many users you don’t know or trust directly from your own
        IP address, revealing it to them.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Knowing your IP address could give other users information about you
        that you’d rather not share: your employer if you’re accessing the
        network from work, your school if you’re accessing it from a campus,
        or a rough guess at your city or town if you’re accessing it from
        home.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        In this way, a peer-to-peer network can be <em>less</em> private than
        a centralized platform like Google or Facebook, where the IP address
        you connect from may be known to the services themselves, some
        intermediaries, and assorted spy agencies, but not in most cases to
        the users you’re communicating with.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        If we’re building a peer-to-peer network that people are going to use
        as an online space, we should offer at least the same level of
        protection of IP address information that Facebook and Google offer.
        Tor, a technology developed for protecting activists and journalists
        from repressive regimes, gives us one way to do that.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Tor isn’t foolproof, its efficacy when used to connect to networks
        like Bitcoin or Zcash is still the subject of research, and Tor might
        actually make these networks
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6079">less secure</a> in some
        ways. But it restores the privacy protections for your IP address when
        you use a peer-to-peer platform instead of a centralized one, so we
        think it’s an important part of the stack, at least until the Zcash
        team addresses this privacy problem directly.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="zb-h3">
        6. Free software has established models for governance.
      </h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        The ability to fork a free software project and build in a new
        direction is a powerful guarantee that over time the software will
        serve its users, but if a free software project is governed in a way
        that is responsive to its users’ and developers’ needs, forking might
        never be necessary. Zbay will strive to find a governance model that
        can align our interests with users, minimizing the necessity of
        forking.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Some free software projects are run by a conventional business. Others
        are run by foundations like the
        <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, the
        nonprofit organization behind the Firefox browser, or the
        <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a>, the nonprofit
        organization that makes the privacy and anonymity tool Tor. Others,
        including many of the basic building blocks of the Internet itself,
        are run through rough consensus of volunteers and paid professionals
        spanning dozens of organizations and companies.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        There are lots of models that make sense and huge troves of experience
        to draw from in deciding how to govern Zbay. Right now, Zbay is still
        just an experiment, so settling on a governance model would be putting
        the cart before the horse, especially given that—if we failed to find
        a good one—forking would always be an option. Nonprofit foundations
        are difficult enough to start and maintain that they aren’t the best
        default starting point for a small free software project. But we do
        have experience starting and operating them (we participated in
        founding
        <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">fightforthefuture.org</a>
        and <a href="https://pculture.org/">pculture.org</a>) if that seems
        like the best path forward.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        There are new structures emerging each year. A
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)"
          >B Corporation</a
        >
        is newer kind of entity that combines the structure of a conventional
        corporation with the declared public interest mission of a nonprofit.
        A
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application"
          >DApp</a
        >
        is a piece of autonomous software that can elect decision-makers,
        approve or reject major proposals, or possibly even approve or reject
        proposed code changes based on a voting algorithm. Peer-to-peer
        networks governed by peer-to-peer networks. Yikes!<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Finally, the network that Zbay uses, Zcash, has its own structures for
        governance. If you like, you can read more about Zcash’s own
        <a href="https://www.zfnd.org/governance/">governance structure</a
        >—the people behind Zcash are putting a ton of thought and work into
        this.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="zb-h3">7. Moderation models and codes of conduct</h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Online spaces aren’t just about how they’re built; the culture and
        community that develop on them are the final piece that matters more
        than anything. With Zbay, we believe that we can stand against
        censorship while still building online communities that are safe,
        respectful, and accountable to the values of diverse communities.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Zbay will soon include established systems for moderation, where
        channel owners can hide posts, ignore problem users, or delegate these
        powers to moderators. Channel owners will have the power they need to
        create functioning online communities built on respect for clear
        principles. Zbay will encourage channel owners to post clear codes of
        conduct that moderators will enforce consistently, and we plan to
        recommend model codes of conduct.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        That said, channel owners have complete freedom to decide the rules
        for their channel, and the fact that Zbay is a free software,
        peer-to-peer, blockchain-based platform guarantees they always will.
        First, the Zcash blockchain is designed for censorship resistance. You
        can't simply delete transactions or messages. When channel owners
        “hide” a message on Zbay, they are sending a new message which tells
        the Zbay app to ignore it. The hidden message is still there, and
        users could modify their Zbay app to display it. If the Zbay team
        added censorship code, an anti-censorship fork could remove it, and no
        human expression would be lost.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        Unlike platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and reddit, users won’t be
        bombarded by an algorithm serving messages from communities users did
        not choose to participate in. Zbay users are not subject to the
        content of Zbay channels unwillingly: they must actively join them and
        can leave at any time.<br />
      </p>

      <p class="zb-p">
        The Zbay team believes that it is morally wrong—and harmful to any
        conceivable notion of political progress—to censor channel owners. Any
        destructive conversation is certain to be outweighed by a larger,
        countervailing, constructive response. The response could come in that
        conversation itself or in other conversations on Zbay, elsewhere on
        the Internet, or years down the road—but it will come: the arc of the
        moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Our commitment to
        this idea is unshakeable, and thanks to the technology we’re building
        on, you don’t even need to take our word for it.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="zb-h3">Fitting it all together</h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        If our goal is to make a patch of online life that’s controlled by the
        people of the Internet, not by big companies or repressive
        governments, we can fit these pieces together to achieve that in Zbay.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Zbay exists as free software available under the GNU GPL. Even if the
        organization and team we’ve created to make Zbay disappears, others
        will be able to take the code and continue. Any developer in the world
        can make improvements to Zbay, and if the Zbay team doesn’t accept
        these improvements, that developer can create their own alternative.
        This guarantees that the people of the Internet will control Zbay’s
        underlying code.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Zbay is peer-to-peer, so Zbay as a platform emerges hive-like when
        many users run the code of the Zbay app. If the code survives, the
        platform survives as well. If developers with a new and better vision
        want to fork the code, they can fork the platform as well. Thanks to
        Zbay being a peer-to-peer network, the control users enjoy over code
        also gives them meaningful control over the platform.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Because Zbay uses a blockchain, it can do some special things that
        used to not be possible in peer-to-peer networks, like registering
        unique usernames or channel names, sending money, and buying or
        selling things. This also lets Zbay use small fees to increase the
        cost of being a bad actor—for example by registering millions of fake
        accounts, sending spam, or scamming other users. Using a blockchain
        network guarantees that competing projects will be able to take
        essential data (like channels, users, and their messages) with them
        when they fork, without needing permission from the team behind
        Zbay&mdash;in stark contrast to centralized services like Facebook,
        where big companies use control over data to lock users and developers
        into the network.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Zbay uses the cutting-edge, privacy-focused blockchain Zcash, so it
        can offer basic privacy protections like end-to-end encryption for
        direct messages and group chats. It can even protect “metadata,”
        knowledge of who is speaking with whom. Zbay also uses Tor (optionally
        right now) to protect users’ IP address from becoming public,
        restoring a basic privacy protection offered by centralized services.
        Unlike a centralized service like Facebook, where privacy guarantees
        are based just on what Facebook <em>says</em> it will do, and
        potentially undermined by laws that require it to collaborate with
        governments in secret, the privacy guarantees in Zbay are based in
        encryption, free software, and peer-to-peer networks which can
        (someday) be studied by researchers and verified to be secure against
        all known attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Zbay has a deep trove of free software governance models to choose
        from, as well as new kinds of entities like the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)"
          >B Corporation</a
        >
        or the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application"
          >DApp</a
        >. The Zcash network on which Zbay is built has a thoughtful and
        evolving governance model. The low cost of forking a free software,
        peer-to-peer, blockchain-based platform creates a baseline guarantee
        that the platform will serve users’ interests. But a good governance
        model can do even better: it can actively solicit and respond to user
        and developer feedback and make smart plans for the future.
      </p>
      <h3 class="zb-h3">What are we waiting for?</h3>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Like many eager observers of the blockchain / cryptocurrency space,
        we’ve felt an enormous pent-up desire for products to come along that
        actually matter to all of us. We saw the first peer-to-peer platforms
        emerge in the early 2000s. We saw Bitcoin and Ethereum emerge years
        later. We watched as a breathtaking amount of investment flowed into
        moonshot-like infrastructure projects to build this new stack for
        decentralized, peer-to-peer, free software applications.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        Still, we’ve felt some pent-up frustration that all this investment
        and passion has produced so few useful tools for our daily lives. When
        do us Internet users get fun products that we can download, play with,
        and use with our friends to build online spaces where people are
        secure and free?
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        When we saw the announcement of the encrypted memo field in Zcash, we
        got excited. For the first time a blockchain stack was natively
        supporting enough protections for user privacy to build something
        really useful beyond finance. We thought, “why wait for somebody else
        to build our dream?” We decided to go for it, and build one of the
        free software, peer-to-peer dream apps we’d always wished would
        exist—something out of a Thomas Pynchon novel: a W.A.S.T.E, or a
        DeepArcher.
      </p>
      <p class="zb-p">
        We decided to take the best big step we could in the direction of a
        world where our online life is controlled by the people of the
        Internet. We built Zbay.
